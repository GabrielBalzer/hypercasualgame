## 1. Introduction
<!-- The introduction of the SRS should provide an overview of the entire SRS -->
### 1.1 Document Purpose
//Describe the purpose of the SRS and its intended audience.
This document intends to target other people, who knows how to programm and are interested in new ideas of projects. We want to inform them about our project and our ideas to develop it further.
### 1.2 Product Scope
This SRS referes to the entire HypercasualGame project. The project is about building a game that is inspired by other very popular sidescroller games. The main tools to create this game are the game engine Unity and C#.
### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations
//Abkürzungsverzeichnis
Not yet specified.
### 1.4 References
//List any other documents or Web addresses to which this SRS refers. These may include user interface style guides, contracts, standards, system requirements specifications, use case documents, or a vision and scope document. Provide enough information so that the reader could access a copy of each reference, including title, author, version number, date, and source or location.
Not yet specified.
### 1.5 Overview
//Describe what the rest of SRS contains and how it is organized.
We will describe the project further in how it works and how we want to organize the structure around the game.
## 2. Overall Description
<!-- This section of the SRS should describe the general factors that affect the product and its requirements. This section does not state specific requirements. Instead, it provides a background for those requirements, which are defined in detail in Section 3 of the SRS, and makes them easier to understand. -->
The Project will feature a Hypercasual-Game with the possibility for a nearly endless gameing experience. That is because of an intelligent rebuilding of levels. The game will be a sidescroller game, with some features in the gameplay to stand out from the crowd.
It will target persons from daily life, who have little to less time to play games, so they play games without much progress. Hypercasual games are specifically for this people. 
## 3. Requirements
<!-- Specify all of the software requirements to a level of detail sufficient to enable designers to design a software system to satisfy those requirements. Specify all of the software requirements to a level of detail sufficient to enable testers to test that the software system satisfies those requirements. At a minimum, describe every input (stimulus) into the software system, every output (response) from the software system, and all functions performed by the software system in response to an input or in support of an output.

The specific requirements should:
a) Be stated in conformance with all the characteristics described in subclause 5.2 of ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2011.
b) Be cross-referenced to earlier documents that relate.
c) Be uniquely identifiable.  -->
### 3.1 External Interfaces
<!-- Define all in puts into and outputs from the software system. Each interface defined should include the following content:
a) Name of item;
b) Description of purpose;
c) Source of input or destination of output;
d) Valid range, accuracy, and/or tolerance;
e) Units of measure;
f) Timing;
g) Relationships to other inputs/outputs;
h) Screen formats/organization;
i) Window formats/organization;
j) Data formats;
k) Command formats;
l) Endmessages. -->
#### 3.1.1 User interfaces
The user can click on the screen and start playing the game.
#### 3.1.3 Software interfaces
Describe the connections between this product and other specific software components (name and version), including databases, operating systems, tools, libraries, and integrated commercial components. Identify the data items or messages coming into the system and going out and describe the purpose of each. Describe the services needed and the nature of communications. Refer to documents that describe detailed application programming interface protocols. Identify data that will be shared across software components. If the data sharing mechanism must be implemented in a specific way (for example, use of a global data area in a multitasking operating system), specify this as an implementation constraint.
### 3.2 Functional
### 3.3 Quality of Service
<!-- Quality requirements state additional, quality-related properties that the functional effects of the  software should have. -->
#### 3.3.1 Performance
A smooth and fast responding game to fit the need of all users.
#### 3.3.2 Availability
After the game is downloaded it is 100% available.
### 3.5 Design and Implementation
#### 3.5.1 Installation
It's a 2D-Game so it should run smooth.
#### 3.5.2 Distribution
It can be obtained through the Play Store or Download Link.
#### 3.5.3 Maintainability
The donwloads will be contributed through the Play store.
#### 3.5.4 Portability
Android and Windows.
